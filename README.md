# Segmentation-of-Godulkiego-Sandstone
The goal of the project was segmentation of minerals in digital images of the Godulkiego Sandstone samples.
For this purpose, a segmentation algorithm based on RandomForest and DL was built, which is described in the [reflection article](https://github.com/SzymonCogiel/Segmentation-of-Godulkiego-Sandstone/blob/master/SEGMENTACJA%20MINERA%C5%81%C3%93W%20W%20PIASKOWCU%20GODULSKIEGO.pdf).
